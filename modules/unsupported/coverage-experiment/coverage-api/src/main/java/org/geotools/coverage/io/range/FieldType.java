/**
 * A {@link net.opengis.wcs11.FieldType} describes a
 * measure/observation/forecast of a certain quantity. A {@link FieldType} may
 * be a scalar (numeric or text) value, such as population density, or a vector
 * of many similar values, such as incomes by race, or radiance by wavelength.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link FieldType} has an associated quantity from the JScience project
 * since the goal of a {@link FieldType} is to describe a {@link Quantity}.
 * Note that I am referring to quantity in the broader term here. As an instance
 * a {@link FieldType} could describe the bands of a synthetic RGB image. Now,
 * there might not be a real physical quantity (like Temperature or Pressure)
 * associated to such a quantity, but still we want to be able to capture
 * somehow the concept of digital number as the represented quantity as well as
 * the concept of the bands index or textual representation for the bands.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that in our proposal a {@link FieldType} shall always contain at least
 * one {@link Axis}.
