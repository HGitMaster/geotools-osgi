     * A datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth
     * thus creating a coordinate reference system. A datum can be used as the
     * basis for one-, two- or three-dimensional systems. In some applications
     * for an Engineering CoordinateReferenceSystem, the relationship is to a moving platform. In
     * these applications the datum itself is not time-dependent, but any
     * transformations of the associated coordinates to a earth-fixed or other
     * coordinate reference system will contain time-dependent parameters.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Five subtypes of datum are specified: geodetic, vertical, engineering,
     * image and temporal. Each datum subtype can be associated only with
     * specific types of coordinate reference systems. A geodetic datum is used
     * with three-dimensional or horizontal (two-dimensional) coordinate
     * reference systems, and requires an ellipsoid definition and a prime
     * meridian definition. It is used to describe large portions of the earth�s
     * surface up to the entire earth�s surface. A vertical datum can only be
     * associated with a vertical coordinate reference system. Image datum and
     * engineering datum are both used in a local context only: to describe the
     * origin of an image and the origin of an engineering (or local) coordinate
     * reference system. A temporal datum is used to define the origin of the
     * time axis in a temporal coordinate reference system.

         * <ul>
         * <li>Geoidal. The zero value of the associated (vertical) coordinate
         * system axis is defined to approximate a constant potential surface,
         * usually the geoid. Such a reference surface is usually determined by
         * a national or scientific authority and is then a well-known, named
         * datum. This is the default vertical datum type, because it is the
         * most common one encountered.</li>
         * <li>Depth. The zero point of the vertical axis is defined by a
         * surface that has meaning for the purpose for which the associated
         * vertical measurements are used. For hydrographic charts, this is
         * often a predicted nominal sea surface (that is, without waves or
         * other wind and current effects) which occurs at low tide. Examples
         * are Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) and Lowest Low Water Springs
         * (LLWS). A different example is a sloping and undulating River Datum
         * defined as the nominal river water surface occurring at a quantified
         * river discharge.</li>
         * <li>Barometric. A vertical datum is of type �barometric� if
         * atmospheric pressure is the basis for the definition of the origin.
         * Atmospheric pressure may be used as the intermediary to determine
         * height (barometric height determination) or it may be used directly
         * as the vertical coordinate, against which other parameters are
         * measured. The latter case is applied routinely in meteorology.</li>
         * <li>Other surface. In some cases, for example oil exploration and
         * production, geological features, such as the top or bottom of a
         * geologically identifiable and meaningful subsurface layer, are
         * sometimes used as a vertical datum. Other variations to the above

         * which it is used. The term �grid cell� is often used as a substitute

         * in two ways with the data attributes of the pixel or grid cell (ISO
         * 19123). The data attributes of the image usually represent an average
         * or integrated value that is associated with the entire pixel.

         * will thus have integer coordinate values. In that case the attribute
         * �pixel in cell� will have the value �cell centre�.

         * <li>An ellipsoid is defined that approximates the surface of the
