<h3>1.  INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The <em>Events</em> package contains a set of Java classes that enable
other classes, notably collections, to be observed. In other words, any changes
made to a class can be observed by listeners.
This document outlines the coding and development standards to use.
</p>

<h3>2.  CODING STANDARDS</h3>

<p>
Events will follow the Sun coding standards. In particular:
</p>
<ul>
<li>no tabs - indent using 4 spaces
<li>brackets around each block - includes single line if and loop statements
<li>open bracket at end of line
<li>single space after keywords and cast
</ul>

<h3>3.  DEVELOPMENT GUIDE</h3>

<p>
The Events package shall build upon other Java designs.
The Java collections framework will be used as the basis for collections design.
Event handling will be based on Java event design.
This paragraph does not prevent alternative implementations, however these should be additional.
