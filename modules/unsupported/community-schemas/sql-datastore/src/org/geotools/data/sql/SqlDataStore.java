/**
 * An extension to the {@link org.geotools.data.DataStore} interface that adds
 * the ability of registering a FeatureType as a SQL SELECT construct
 * against featuretypes and/or normal table like data that the DataStore could deal with.
 * <p>
 * A DataStore implementing this interface does not necesarilly has to be backed
 * by a RDBMS. Implementing this interface only means that the DataStore _is able_ to
 * expose a non existent FeatureType in its backend, by somehow executing the 
 * SQL STATEMENT represented by the sql selct object model passed to {@link #registerView(String, PlainSelect)}
 * or {@link #registerView(String, Union)}.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * Implementing datastores are free to support only a subset of the SQL constructs
 * that may be used to create a full SELECT statement.
 * </p>
