  Support for drawable axis with graduation. Axis objects
  ({@link org.geotools.axis.Axis2D}) are lines ({@link java.awt.geom.Line2D})
  with a graduation ({@link org.geotools.axis.Graduation}). Axis are graduated
  from the starting point ({@link java.awt.geom.Line2D#getP1()}) to the end
  point ({@link java.awt.geom.Line2D#getP2()}). Since axis can have arbitrary
  starting and end points (usually expressed in pixel coordinates), axis can be
  located anywhere in a widget and have any direction: vertical, horizontal,
  inclined, increasing up or down, etc. Two axis don't have to be perpendicular.
  As long as they are not parallel, it is always possible to construct an
  {@link java.awt.geom.AffineTransform} mapping logical values to pixel
  coordinates on any arbitrary axis, no matter their orientation.
