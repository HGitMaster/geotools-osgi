  Workaround for the missing {@code javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.getUserObject()}
  method. Sun seem to have forgotten this method in the first <cite>Swing</cite>
  draft. Unfortunately, since {@link javax.swing.tree.TreeNode} is an interface,
  Sun can't fix it without breaking compatibility. We have to fix it ourselves,
  which is the main purpose of this package.
