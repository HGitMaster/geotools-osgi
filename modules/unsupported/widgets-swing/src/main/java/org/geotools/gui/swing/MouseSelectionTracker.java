/**
 * Controller which allows the user to select a region of a component. The user must click on a
 * point in the component, then drag the mouse pointer whilst keeping the button pressed. During
 * the dragging, the shape which is drawn will normally be a rectangle.  Other shapes could always
 * be used such as, for example, an ellipse. To use this class, it is necessary to create a derived
 * class which defines the following methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #selectionPerformed} (obligatory)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getModel} (optional)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This controller should then be registered with one, and only one, component
 * using the following syntax:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * {@link Component} component=...
 * MouseSelectionTracker control=...
 * component.addMouseListener(control);
 * </pre></blockquote>
