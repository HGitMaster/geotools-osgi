/**
 * List of tiles inside the bounding box of a bigger (or equals in size) tile. This class fills
 * a similar purpose than RTree, except that we do not calculate any new bounding boxes. We try
 * to fit children in existing tile bounds on the assumption that most tile layouts are already
 * organized in some form pyramid.
 * <p>
 * The value of the inherited rectangle is the {@linkplain Tile#getAbsoluteRegion absolute region}
 * of the tile, computed and stored once for ever for efficienty during searchs. This class extends
 * {@link Rectangle} for pure opportunist reasons, in order to reduce the amount of object created
 * (because we will have thousands of TreeNodes) and for direct (no indirection, no virtual calls)
 * invocation of {@link Rectangle} services. We authorize ourself this unrecommendable practice only
 * because this class is not public. The inherited {@link Rectangle} should <string>never</strong>
 * be modified by anyone outside this class.
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link #compareTo} method is inconsistent with {@link #equals}. It should
 * be considered as an implementation details exposed because this class is not public.
