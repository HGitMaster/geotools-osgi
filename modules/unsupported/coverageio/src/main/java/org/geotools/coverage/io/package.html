    Helper classes for coverage reader implementations.
    {@link org.geotools.coverage.io.AbstractGridCoverageReader} is the base class for any object
    capable to read a {@link org.geotools.coverage.grid.GridCoverage2D} object.

    <P ALIGN="justify">Sometime, remote sensing data are not contained in a single file.
    For example it is common to find sample values in a raw binary file (a flat matrix),
    and metadata informations in a separated text file. There is a wide variety of formats
    for such text file, and supporting them is not always straightforward.
    {@link org.geotools.coverage.io.MetadataBuilder} is a helper class for making
    easier to parse the header file. The content (the actual pixel values) can be parsed using
    the {@link org.geotools.image.io} package.</P>
