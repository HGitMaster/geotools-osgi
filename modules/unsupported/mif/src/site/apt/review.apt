  Cannot determine date offline :-( Seem to think this may be a port of an old GeoTools Data Source
  from before the 2.0 release. Could guess it is after 2003 due to header aggreement with the
  developers guide, but will need to check.
  Update: Luca based this code on the previous MapInfoDataStore but is a complete
  rewrite! The test data has one file of real data (C) Agenzia Milanese Mobilite e Ambiente
