/**
 * GeoTools allows for more pervase use of Expression then is strictly
 * supported by the specification.
 * <p>
 * To make the distiniction clear, generic use of Expression for SortBy has
 * been issolated to this interface. You shoudl note that this is outside
 * of the bounds of the Expression specification, and you will not be able
 * to construct valid documents if you use any other expression then
 * AttributeExpression.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Code that is compatible with the expanded use will indicate
 * via acceptance of a SortBy2 parameter. If you are working with a strictly
 * standards complient service (like WFS 1.1) it will be limited
 * to the use of SortBy.
