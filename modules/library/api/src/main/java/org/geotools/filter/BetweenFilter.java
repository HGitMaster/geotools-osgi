/**
 * Defines a 'between' filter (which is a specialized compare filter). A
 * between filter is just shorthand for a less-than-or-equal filter ANDed with
 * a greater-than-or-equal filter.  Arguably, this would be better handled
 * using those constructs, but the OGC filter specification creates its own
 * object for this, so we do as well.  An important note here is that a
 * between filter is actually a math filter, so its outer (left and right)
 * expressions must be math expressions.  This is enforced by the
 * FilterAbstract class, which considers a BETWEEN operator to be a math
 * filter.
