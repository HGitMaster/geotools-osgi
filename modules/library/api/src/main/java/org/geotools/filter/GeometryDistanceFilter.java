/**
 * Defines geometry filters with a distance element.
 *
 * <p>
 * These filters are defined in the filter spec by the DistanceBufferType,
 * which contains an additioinal field for a distance.  The two filters that
 * use the distance buffer type are Beyond and DWithin.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * From the spec: The spatial operators DWithin and Beyond test whether the
 * value of a geometric property is within or beyond a specified distance of
 * the specified literal geometric value.  Distance values are expressed using
 * the Distance element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For now this code does not take into account the units of distance,  we will
 * assume that the filter units are the same as the geometry being filtered.
