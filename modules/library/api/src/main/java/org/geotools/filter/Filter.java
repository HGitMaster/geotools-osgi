     * <p>
     * This is the core function of any filter.  'Contains' isn't a very good
     * term for this method because it implies some sort of spatial
     * relationship between the feature and the filter that may or may  not
     * exist.  We name this method 'contains' only because the usage  of
     * 'contains' in this context is common and better terms are lacking.
     * However, users of this method should keep in mind the non-spatial
     * nature of this meaning of 'contains.'  For example, a feature may be
     * 'contained by' a filter if one of the feature's non-spatial property
     * values is equal to that of the filter's.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Although some filters can be checked for validity when they are
     * constructed, it is impossible to impose this check on all expressions
     * because of a special feature of the <code>ExpressionAttribute</code>
     * class.  This class must hold the pointer (in XPath) to an attribute,
     * but it is not passed the actual attribute (inside a feature) until it
     * calls the <code>isInside</code> class.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * To avoid a run-time Exception, this class is typed (ie. Double, Integer,
     * String) when it is created.  If the attribute found inside the feature
     * is found not to conform with its stated type, then a
     * <code>MalformedExpressionException</code> is thrown when <code>
     * contains</code> is called.  Since <code>ExpressionAttribute</code>
     * classes may be nested inside any filter, all filters must throw this
     * exception.  It is left to callers of this method to deal with it
     * gracefully.
