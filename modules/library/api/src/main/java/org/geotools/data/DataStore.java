/**
 * Represents a Physical Store for FeatureTypes.
 *
 * <p>
 * The source of data for FeatureTypes. Shapefiles, databases tables, etc. are
 * referenced through this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Summary of our requirements:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Provides lookup of available Feature Types
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access to low-level Readers/Writers API for a feature type
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access to high-level FeatureSource/Store/Locking API a feature type
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Handles the conversion of filters into data source specific queries
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Handles creation of new Feature Types
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access of Feature Type Schema information
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Suggestions:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>GeoAPI - has reduced this to api to the FeatureStore construct
 *     Jody - since we are no longer using the FeatureReader/ReaderWriter in client
 *            code this would not be a bad idea.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
