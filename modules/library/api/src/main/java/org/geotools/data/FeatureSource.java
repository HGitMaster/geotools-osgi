 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Differences from DataStore:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * This is a prototype DataSource replacement, the Transaction methods have
 * been moved to an external object, and the locking api has been intergrated.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * FeatureCollection<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature> has been replaced with FeatureResult as we do not wish to
 * indicate that results can be stored in memory.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * FeatureSource<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature> has been split into three interfaces, the intention is to use
 * the instanceof opperator to check capabilities rather than the previous
 * DataSourceMetaData.
 * </li>

     * Returns the qualified name for the Features this FeatureSource serves.
     * <p>
     * Note this is different from {@code getSchema().getType().getName()} (that
     * is, the feature type name), this name specifies the
     * {@link PropertyDescriptor#getName() AttributeDescriptor name} for the
     * Features served by this source. So,
     * {@code FeatureSoruce.getName() ==  FeatureSource.getFeatures().next().getAttributeDescriptor().getName()}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Though it's a common practice when dealing with {@link SimpleFeatureType}
     * and {@link SimpleFeature} to assume they're equal. There's no conflict
     * (as per the dynamic typing system the {@code org.opengis.feature} package
     * defines) in a Feature and its type sharing the same name, as well as in a
     * GML schema an element declaration and a type definition may be named the
     * same. Yet, the distinction becomes important as we get rid of that
     * assumption and thus allow to reuse a type definition for different
     * FeatureSoruces, decoupling the descriptor (homologous to the Feature
     * element declaration in a GML schema) from its type definition.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * So, even if implementors are allowed to delegate to
     * {@code getSchema().getName()} if they want to call the fatures and their
     * type the same, client code asking a
     * {@link DataAccess#getFeatureSource(Name)} shall use this name to request
     * for a FeatureSource, rather than the type name, as used in pre 2.5
     * versions of GeoTools. For example, if we have a FeatureSource named
     * {@code Roads} and its type is named {@code Roads_Type}, the
     * {@code DataAccess} shall be queried through {@code Roads}, not
     * {@code Roads_Type}.
