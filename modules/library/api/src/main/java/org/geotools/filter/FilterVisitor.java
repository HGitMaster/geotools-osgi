/**
 * An interface for classes that want to perform operations on a Filter
 * hierarchy. It forms part of a GoF Visitor Patern implementation. A call to
 * filter.accept(FilterVisitor) will result in a call to one of the methods in
 * this interface. The responsibility for traversing sub filters is intended
 * to lie with the visitor (this is unusual, but permited under the Visitor
 * pattern). A typical use would be to transcribe a filter into a specific
 * format, e.g. XML or SQL.  Alternativly it may be to extract specific
 * infomration from the Filter strucure, for example a list of all bboxes.
