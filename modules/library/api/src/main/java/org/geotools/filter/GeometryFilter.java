/**
 * Implements a geometry filter.
 *
 * <p>
 * This filter implements a relationship - of some sort -  between two geometry
 * expressions. Note that this comparison does not attempt to restict its
 * expressions to be meaningful.  This means that it considers itself a valid
 * filter as long as it contains two <b>geometry</b> sub-expressions. It is
 * also slightly less  restrictive than the OGC Filter specification because
 * it does not require that one sub-expression be an geometry attribute and
 * the other be a geometry literal.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In other words, you may use this filter to compare two geometries in the
 * same feature, such as: attributeA inside attributeB?  You may also compare
 * two literal geometries, although this is fairly meaningless, since it could
 * be reduced (ie. it is always either true or false).  This approach is very
 * similar to that taken in the FilterCompare class.
 * </p>

 * @todo REVISIT: make this class (and all filters) immutable, implement
 *       cloneable and return new filters when calling addLeftGeometry and
 *       addRightG Issues to think through: would be cleaner immutability to
 *       have constructor called with left and right Geometries, but this does
 *       not jive with SAX parsing, which is one of the biggest uses of
 *       filters.  But the alternative is not incredibly efficient either, as
 *       there will be two filters that  are just thrown away every time we
 *       make a full geometry filter.  These issues extend to most filters, as
 *       just about all of them are mutable when creating them.  Other issue
 *       is that lots of code will need to  be changed for immutability.
 *       (comments by cholmes) - MUTABLE FACTORIES!  Sax and immutability.
