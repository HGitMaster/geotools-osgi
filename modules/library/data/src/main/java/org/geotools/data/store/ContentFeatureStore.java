/**
 * Abstract implementation of FeatureStore.
 * <p>
 * List its base class {@link ContentFeatureSource}, this feature store works off 
 * of operations provided by {@link FeatureCollection}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #addFeatures(FeatureCollection<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature>)} method is used to add features to
 * the feature store. The method should return the "persistent" feature id's 
 * which are generated after the feature has been added to persistent storage.
 * Often the persistent fid is different from the fid specified by the actual 
 * feature being inserted. For this reason {@link SimpleFeature#getUserData()} is
 * used to report back persistent fids. It is up to the implementor of the 
 * feature collection to report this value back after a feature has been inserted.
 * As an example, consider an implementation of {@link FeatureCollection#add(Object)}.
 * <pre>
 *  boolean add( Object o ) {
 *    SimpleFeature feature = (SimpleFeature) o;
 *    
 *    //1.add the feature to storage
 *    ...
 *    
 *    //2. derive the persistent fid
 *    String fid = ...;
 *    
 *    //3. set the user data
 *    feature.getUserData().put( "fid", fid );
 *  
 *  }
 * </pre>
