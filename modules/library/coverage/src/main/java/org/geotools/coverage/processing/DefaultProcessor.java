/**
 * Default implementation of a {@linkplain Coverage coverage} processor.
 * This default implementation makes the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Operations are declared in the
 *       {@code META-INF/services/org.opengis.coverage.processing.Operation} file.</li>
 *   <li>Operations are actually instances of {@link AbstractOperation} (note: this constraint
 *       may be relaxed in a future version after GeoAPI interfaces for grid coverage will be
 *       redesigned).</li>
 *   <li>Most operations are backed by <cite>Java Advanced Imaging</cite>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This implementation do not caches produced coverages. Since coverages
 * may be big, consider wrapping {@code DefaultProcessor} instances in {@link BufferedProcessor}.
 *
 * @since 2.2
 * @source $URL$
