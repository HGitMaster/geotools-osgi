/**
 * The FeatureCollectionIteration provides a depth first traversal of a
 * FeatureCollection<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature> which will call the provided call-back Handler. Because
 * of the complex nature of Features, which may have other Features (or even a
 * collection of Features) as attributes, the handler is repsonsible for
 * maintaining its own state as to where in the traversal it is recieving
 * events from. Many handlers will not need to worry about state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Notes:</b> The depth first visitation is implemented
 * through recursion. The limits to recursion depending on the settings in the
 * JVM, but some tests show a 2 argument recursive having a limit of ~50000
 * method calls with a stack size of 512k (the standard setting).
