/**
 * Starting place for holding information about a FeatureType.
 * <p>
 * Like say for instance the FeatureType, its metadata and so on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default implemenation should contain enough information to wean
 * us off of AbstractDataStore. That is it should provide its own locking
 * and event notification.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is a naming convention:
 * <ul>
 * <li> data access follows bean conventions: getTypeName(), getSchema()
 * <li> resource access methods follow Collections conventions reader(), 
 * writer(), etc...
 * <li> overrrides are all protected and follow factory conventions:
 *  createWriter(), createAppend(), createFeatureSource(),
 *  createFeatureStore(), etc...
 * </ul>
 * <li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Feedback:
 * <ul>
 * <li>even notification yes
 * <li>locking not - locking needs to be rejuggled
 * <li>naming convention really helps when subclassing
 * </ul>
