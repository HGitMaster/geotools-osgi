 *
 * @task TODO: This needs to be massively overhauled.  This should be the
 *       source of immutability of filters.  See {@link FeatureTypeFactory},
 *       as that provides a good example of what this should look like.  The
 *       mutable factory to create immutable objects is a good model for this.
 *       The creation methods should only create fully formed filters.  This
 *       in turn means that all the set functions in the filters should be
 *       eliminated.  When rewriting this class/package, keep in mind
 *       FilterSAXParser in the filter module, as the factory should fit
 *       cleanly with that, and should handle sax parsing without too much
 *       memory overhead.
 * @task REVISIT: resolve errors, should all throw errors?
 *
 * @deprecated Replaced by {@link org.geotools.factory.CommonFactoryFinder#getFilterFactory}.
