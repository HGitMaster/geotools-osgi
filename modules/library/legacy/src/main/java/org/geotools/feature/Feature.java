/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a feature of arbitrary complexity.
 * <p>
 * This interface answers the question: How do we store feature attributes?
 * (The answer to the more useful question, How do we access feature attribute,
 * is contained in the Expression class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Warning: We are revising the Feature Model to be more complete in the
 * next round of GeoTools. If you do any data access in your classes please try
 * and make use of Expression to access your information, if you do this you will
 * not be affected by the change (beyond a few search and replace operations).
 * </p>
 * The most generic approach would be to pass all feature attributes as objects
 * and use Java variable and method references to access them.  However, this is
 * also the most useless approach because it establishes no unified methods for getting
 * attribute information (since it is totally Object dependent), without
 * elaborate reflection/introspection, which is inconvenient to use. Unlike
 * its {@link FeatureType} counterpart, this interface does not attempt to
 * serve as a typing framework.  Rather, multiple implementations of this
 * interface should generally be for performance reasons.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface serves two important purposes.  Most obviously, it gives
 * users of features a unified, consistent framework for accessing and
 * manipulating feature data.  Perhaps more importantly,  the
 * <code>FeatureType</code> and <code>Feature</code> interfaces also work
 * together to give implementers a framework for constraining and enforcing
 * constraints (respectively) on allowed feature types. As such, this
 * interface is as general as possible in terms of the types of objects to
 * which it provides access. Keep in mind that creating new features is
 * relatively difficult and should only be done to optimize performance for
 * highly constrained schema types. For the vast majority of schemas, the
 * generic feature implementation will  work fine.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Notes for Feature Clients:</b><br>
 * Clients should always use feature accessor methods (getAttribute and
 * setAttribute) to modify the state of internal attribute objects.  It is
 * possible that some feature implementations will allow object state changes
 * by clients outside of the class, but this is strongly discouraged. In
 * general, feature implementations will make defensive copies of objects
 * passed to clients and it is therefore not guaranteed that client state
 * changes that take place outside of the feature will be reflected in the
 * internal state of the feature object!  <i>For this reason, clients should
 * always use the set methods to change feature attribute object states!</i>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Notes for Feature Implementers:</b><br>
 * It is the responsibility of the implementing class to ensure that the
 * <code>Feature</code> attributes stay synchronized with its FeatureType
 * definition. <i>Features should never get out of synch with their declared
 * schemas and should never alter their schemas!</i>  There are four
 * conventions of which implementers of this interface must be aware in order
 * to successfully manage a <code>Feature</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <b>FeatureType Reference</b><br>
 * Features must always hold a single (immutable: see
 * <code>FeatureType</code>) schema reference and this reference should not be
 * altered after a feature has been created.  To ensure this, is is strongly
 * recommended that features take a valid reference to an existing immutable
 * schema in its constructor and declare that reference final.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Default Geometry</b><br>
 * Each feature must have a default geometry, but this primary geometry may be
 * null.  This means that a feature may contain no geometries, but it must
 * always have a method for accessing a geometry object (even if it is null).
 * It also means that a feature with multiple geometries must pick one as its
 * default geometry.  Note that the designation of the default geometry is
 * stored as part of the <code>FeatureType</code> and is therefore immmutable.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Attributes</b><br> All features contain zero or more attributes, which
 * can have one or more occurrences inside the feature.  Attributes may be any
 * valid Java object. If attributes are instances of <code>Feature</code>,
 * they are handled specially by the <code>Feature</code> methods, in that
 * their attributes may be accessed directly by their containing feature.  All
 * other object variables and methods must be accessed through the objects
 * themselves. It is up to implementers of <code>Feature</code> to make sure
 * that each attribute value conforms to its internal schema.  A feature
 * should never reach a state where its attributes (or sub-attributes) do not
 * conform to their <code>FeatureType</code> definitions.  There are three
 * ways to implement this.  The first is to simply make features immutable;
 * however, given the ubiquity and required flexibility of features, this is
 * likely not possible. The second (and second easiest), is to make all
 * feature attributes immutable. For most cases, this is probably the best way
 * to handle this issue. The third way, is to never give out a reference that
 * would allow a client to change an attribute object's class (most obviously,
 * an array reference). Generally speaking, features should attempt to
 * minimize external object references by attempting to clone incoming
 * attributes before adding them and outgoing attributes before sending them.
 * For features with non-cloneable attributes, of course, this is not
 * possible, so this is left to the discretion of the implementor.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Constructors</b><br> Constructors should take arguments with enough
 * information to create a valid representation of the feature.  They should
 * also always include a  valid schema that can be used to check the proposed
 * attributes.  This is necessary to ensure that the feature is always in a
 * valid state, relative to its schema.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>hashCode() and equals(Object other)</b><br>
 * Determining equality and equivalence for Feature instances is of utmost
 * importance. This must be done in a constistent manner, as many other areas
 * of geotools will rely on these relations. See java.lang.Object for details.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
