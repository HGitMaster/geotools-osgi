/**
 * <p>
 * Stores metadata about a single attribute object.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Name: A string that is used to reference the attribute.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Nillable: if nulls are allowed as this attribute.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Type: The expected Java class of this attribute.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * AttributeTypes must also provide the <code>validate(Object obj)</code>
 * method, which determines whether a given object matches the constraints
 * imposed by the AttributeType.  In a default attribute this will simply be
 * that it is of the correct class and non-null (or null if isNillable is
 * true).  More complex AttributeTypes can impose any restrictions that they
 * like.  Nested FeatureTypes are an example of this, as they need to check
 * that the Feature object matches all its constraints, not that it is  just
 * of class Feature.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Additionally, implementors may use the parse method to convert an object to
 * its preferred storage type.  If an implementor does not choose to provide
 * any functionality for this method they should simple return the object
 * passed in.  If parsing is attempted and not successful, then an exception
 * should be thrown.  This method is primarily used by FeatureType to try to
 * convert objects to the correct storage type, such as a string of a double
 * when the AttributeType requires a Double.

     * 1) removed isNested() from the api as are going to incorporating

     * isNested() was used very little, and was never fully thought through
     * So killing it should not have too much of an effect.
     *
     * 2) Added minOccurs and maxOccurs since we are going to get into
     * multiplicity, where this matters.  The isNilleable is not enough
     *
     * 3) deprecated isGeometry() as it is a convenience method that can
     * be accomplished in different ways, and it means nothing for a
     * featureType
     *
     * 4) We are planning on killing getFieldLength, as it is extremely
     * impercise, has no general meaning.  We are going to replace it
     * with the concept of xml facets, hopefully we will have time to.
