/**
 * This level of inheritance is intended for documentation purposes ... 
 * so read carefully :). 
 * 
 * A nested Attribute is equivalent to a weak feature, or a feature without a Fid.
 * This distinction is important because there is very little difference between 
 * a Java Bean and a nested Attribute, except the existance of this class. 
 * This class is a simplified version of the XML schema which would be used to 
 * represent this object as XML. 
 * 
 * The other subtle divergence between a Nested Attribute, and a Feature is the 
 * idea that a Feature can be translated into and out of GML, while a Nested 
 * Attribute is really just a typed Object. Much of what is represented within 
 * the Nested Attribute and NestedAttributeType can, and is duplicated in many 
 * bean2xml and xml2bean libraries (they use introspection ... we declare it in 
 * a human readable form).
