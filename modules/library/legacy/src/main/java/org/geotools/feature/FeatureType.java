/**
 * A metadata template for a Feature of arbitrary complexity.
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>that this documentation should be read in conjunction with the {@link Feature}API.
 * <li>the attributes described by this FeatureType <b>and its ancestors </b> define the complete
 * schema for a Feature
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface answers the question: How do we represent features within GeoTools? Of course, the
 * most general answer would be: features can be any Java object. However, this is also the least
 * useful solution because it means that users of features have essentially no way to find out about
 * the meaning of features other than using Java introspection/reflection. This is too cumbersome
 * and is insufficient for the goal of creating a simple framework for manipulating and accessing
 * generic geographic data. The opposite approach might be to define a very constrained set of
 * possible attributes (that, for example, mirrored Java primitives and OGC simple geometries) and
 * only allow features of this type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface takes a different approach: it defines a minimal ontology for representing a
 * feature and serves as a consistent framework for defining more constrained (and, therefore, often
 * more meaningful) feature types. A <code>FeatureType</code> represents features as an object
 * that contains zero or more attribute objects, one of which will generally be a geometry, but no
 * geometry and multiple geometries are allowed, according to implementation. Note that instances of
 * implementations of this class are henceforth referred to as schemas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With oneexceptions, the type of an attribute is considered to be its cannonical definition by the
 * FeatureType. For example, an attribute type might be a <code>javax.sound.midi.Sequence</code>
 * object, which contains a <code>float</code> public field called PPQ. The fact that this
 * attribute exists is not known by the <code>FeatureType</code> itself. If a caller asks this
 * <code>FeatureType</code> for all of its attributes, the <code>
 * FeatureType</code> will tell
 * the caller that it has an attribute of type <code>javax.sound.midi.Sequence</code>, but not
 * that this attribute has a sub-attribute (field) called PPQ. It is the responsibility of the
 * callers to understand the objects it is asking for and manipulate them appropriately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The exceptions is for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the type stored in the <code>FeatureType</code> is a
 * <code>org.geotools.datasource.Feature</code> type. <br>
 * In this case, all information about sub-attributes are stored and passed to calling classes upon
 * request. The style of reference (XPath) is defined in and mediated by <code>FeatureType</code>
 * implementations.
 * </ul>
 * Question: how does one determine the schema for the attribute defined as a FeatureType? I suspect
 * that FeatureType may be a valid AttributeType? (One needs this schema information before xpath
 * can be used to query the Feature value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is the responsibility of the implementing class to ensure that the <code>FeatureType</code>
 * is always in a valid state. This means that each attribute tuple must be fully initialized and
 * valid. The minimum valid <code>FeatureType</code> is one with nulls for namespace, type, and
 * attributes; this is clearly a trivial case, since it is so constrained that it would not allow
 * for any feature construction. There are a few conventions of which implementers of this interface
 * must be aware in order to successfully manage a <code>FeatureType</code>:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Immutability </b> <br>
 * <i>FeatureTypes must be implemented as immutable objects! </i> All setting methods have been
 * removed from this interface, that functionality is now available in the mutable {@link
 * FeatureTypeFactory}</li>
 * <li><b>Default Geometries </b> <br>
 * Note that the FeatureType contains a special methods for handling geometries. The primary
 * geometry retrieval methods are in <code>Feature</code> because they may change over the life of
 * the feature, while the schema may not. In cases where there are more than one geometries it is up
 * to the implementor to determine which is the default geometry. <code>getDefaultGeometry</code>
 * may return <code>null</code> if there are no geometries in the FeatureType, but if there is one
 * or more geometry then the method must return one of them, <code>null</code> is never an
 * acceptable return value.</li>
 * <li><b>XPath </b> <br>
 * XPath is the standard used to access all attributes (flat, nested, and multiple), via a single,
 * unified string. Using XPath to access attributes has the convenient side-benefit of making them
 * appear to be non-nested and non-multiple to callers with no awareness of XPath. This greatly
 * simplifies accessing and manipulating data. However, it does put extra burden on the implementers
 * of <code>FeatureType</code> to understand and correctly implement XPath pointers. Note that the
 * <code>Feature</code> object does not understand XPath at all and relies on implementors of this
 * interface to interpret XPath references. Fortunately, XPath is quite simple and has a clearly
 * written <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">specification </a>.</li>
 * <li><b>Feature Creation </b> <br>
 * FeatureType also must provide methods for the creation of Features, as specified in
 * FeatureFactory. The creating FeatureType should check to see if the passed in objects validate
 * against its AttributeTypes, and if it does should return a new Feature.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h2>Redesign Notes (feature-exp2)</h2>
 * The main design goal of this is to have FeatureType extend AttributeType. This allows us to
 * nesting of features much more nicely. We already are going in this direction, with the
 * FeatureAttributeType buried in DefaultAttribute. This is just making it explicit, so it works
 * with the complex objects GML can return a lot more sensible. So much of the work in this class is
 * figuring out what concepts are the same. Some stuff may need to be rethought a bit, as there are
 * a few subtle assumptions that we are working with flat files. We will revisit this when we
 * implement choice and multiplicity.
 * <ul>
 * <li>got rid of deprecated getNamespace() method that returned a string, replaced it with a URI
 * return. This has been deprecated for a bit, and was done out of a desire to keep backwards
 * compatibility with 2.0, but that mission failed, so we're just moving on. This change will break
 * a few things, but is a good one, people just need to update their client code a bit.
 * <li>Deprecated getTypeName() to be getName(). They are the same thing, would be nice to get rid
 * of getTypeName, but it's used super extensively. Though perhaps we could consider keeping it as a
 * convenience, a bit more explicit, but it seems like overkill.
 * <li>Updated comments of the AttributeType operations that are inhierited to say what they mean
 * in the context of a FeatureType.
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Redesign Notes (factory-hints)</h2>
 * The factory-hints design is finally coming through on the promiss of the great geotools factory
 * design. This design is actualy placing the factory system under application (rather than
 * 'default') control, as such it is really showing every last place where we did not follow our
 * architecture.
 * <ul>
 * Use Cases:
 * <li>Custom Feature: <br>
 * Application spedcifies the use of a custom feature implementation. This is used so an application
 * interface is supported by each and every feature created.
 * <li>optiomized coordinate storage <br>
 * LiteRenderer2 wants Shape2d specific CoordinateSequenceFactory used for all Geometry creation.
 * The point is to allow only the xy information to be retrieved, and in a format suitable for rapid
 * reprojection and coversion to a Java2D Shape. Any OpenGL (or Java3D) based renderer would also
 * run into this need.
 * </ul>
 * The second use case is interesting in that LiteRenderer2 will be using the Datastore at the same
 * time as other threads that want the normal coordinate sequence. So this is a per Query hint.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Consequence: Since FeatureType is immutable, and CoordianteSequence is specified by the
 * GeometryFactory of the DefaultGeometryAttribute this implys that we have a per Query SchemaType.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It strikes me that this is a bad separation of concerns the "schema" should be exactly the same,
 * it is just the GeometryFactory that controls construction that is in the wrong spot. It should be
 * a hint, not attached to GeomtryAttributeType.
