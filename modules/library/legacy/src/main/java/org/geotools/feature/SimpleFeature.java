/**
 * A simple feature is one that does not have any nested attributes, and  that
 * has no multiplicity for each attribute.  In non xml speak this means that
 * the attributes returned are guaranteed to be the Objects you would expect -
 * not Lists as is the case when Features are non-simple.  This is  thus a
 * constraining extension - it essentially allows you to make a few more
 * assumptions about the nature of the {@link Feature} you are getting back.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The notion of a Simple Feature is drawn from the OGC's Simple Features for
 * SQL specification - where a simple feature represents a single row in  a
 * database table.  This extends beyond databases though, to flat files, for
 * example.  A database does not necessarily only return simple features -
 * indeed by relying on foreign keys much more complex structures can be
 * created.  But at the time of the creation of this class all GeoTools
 * datastores return Simple Features - they just were not explicitly called
 * that.  Making explicit that they are Simple should hopefully encourage more
 * complex Features to be returned.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The assumptions one can make with Simple Features are as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If  {@link #getAttribute(int)}  is called then it will always return an
 * actual object, instead of a List,  as is common in the parent Feature
 * class.  That is to say a Simple Feature will never have more than one
 * attribute in any of its positions, so the interface just assumes that you
 * want the actual object, instead of a List containing just the object.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If {@link #setAttribute(int, Object)} is called then a similar assumption is
 * made about the object being set - it need be a List, will default to
 * setting the attribute itself.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #getAttribute(String)} and {@link #setAttribute(String, Object)}
 * implicitly append a [0], as that's the behavior implementors expect -  to
 * name an attribute and get it back.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To figure out if a Feature is a SimpleFeature one may call instanceof.  For
 * a number of Features returned from a DataStore it will save much energy if
 * instanceof is called on the FeatureType, to check if it is a {@link
 * SimpleFeatureType}.  And in the future we should have FeatureCollections
 * that know their types.
 * </p>

 * @task REVISIT: I am not sure that I like getAttribute returning the  object
 *       straight away.  It might be better to have a getFirstAttribute()
 *       method in Feature.java, and move people to get used to calling that,
 *       or  else to expect a List (which in a SimpleFeature would always only
 *       contain one Object).  This would seem to make the api a bit cleaner
