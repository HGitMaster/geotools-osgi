/**
 * Determines which parts of a Filter can be turned into valid SQL statements.
 * Given a filter it constructs two filters, one of the supported parts of the
 * filter passed in, one of the unsupported.  If one of the constructed
 * filters is null (ie the whole filter is supported or unsupported), it is
 * the clients responsibility to deal with that.  The SQLUnpacker should be
 * tightly coordinated with the SQLEncoder.  The SQLEncoder passes its
 * Capabilities (ie which filters it can encode and which it can't) to the
 * Unpacker, and the Unpacker returns a supported filter, which should be
 * passed to the Encoder as the Encoder Capabilities claimed to fully support
 * everything in the supported  filter.  The unsupported filter should be used
 * after the SQL statement is executed, testing each feature in the result set
 * with the contains method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This Unpacker can likely be easily used with any Encoder that has a
 * FilterCapabilities of the actions it can perform.  May want to rename it
 * FilterUnpacker, as it is  likely generic enough, but for now this name
 * should be fine, to emphasize that the SQLEncoder needs to be closely linked
 * to it to work properly.

 * @task REVISIT: The getSupported getUnsupported is clunky and dangerous, as
 *       clients could be using this and do an unpack, get the unsupported
 *       filter, and then do another unpack, and want to get the first
 *       supported filter,  and would get the second instead.  This is likely
 *       in a getFeatures when the unpacker is held by the class.  So for now
 *       clients should construct an unpacker whenever they want to use it.
 *       This is obviously less than ideal.  So this should be revisited.  One
 *       way is fir the unpack methods to  return FilterPairs, for the clients
 *       to deal with themselves.  I'm not  sure that this is the best
 *       semantic, and it exposes an inner class that really has no other use,
 *       so it could be nice to do it a better way. Another option is to have
 *       static  methods SQLUnpacker.getSupported(Filter, splitType,
 *       capabilities), or something to that effect.  Or non static, but pass
 *       the filter in  each time.  If anyone is looking at this class and has
 *       suggestions email the list, as we should think this through more, but
 *       I've other pressing  tasks.
