TODO
-----------------------------------------------
- some default objects are missing in our API
- text and raster symbolizer builders are missing
- deal with the few deprecated items
- should the builder validate the inputs? (null URL, negative scales?)
- shall we build the upper layer as well (StyledLayerDescriptorBuilder?)
- pass down the style factory from parent to child and have each
  accept it in the constructor as well
