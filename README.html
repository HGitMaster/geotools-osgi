<h3>NOTE</h3>
<p>
The details contained in the rest of this file are provided as a quick start
reference. For full details on requirements and build process please see
the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOT/Home">Developers' Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>
To use the geotools libraries you will need:
<ul>
<li>Java 5 or higher.
<li>The Java Advanced Imaging Libraries (JAI)
<li>The Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The JAI and the JAI I/O Tools are standard extensions to Java created by SUN.  
They have versions specific to different platforms so we cannot distribute them
as part of the release.
</p>

<p>
You can obtain the latest versions of both of these <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html">here</a>. Detailed instructions can be found <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Dependencies">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>ORACLE REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>
In order to use the Oracle module, you need the Oracle JDBC driver
from Oracle. Unlike most external libraries used in GeoTools, we
cannot redistribute this jar.
</p>
<p>
However, you can obtain them from the Oracle website, free of charge,
after registering:
- http://otn.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html
  
Please see the developers guide for more information.
</p>

<h3>BUILDING</h3>
<p>
In order to build GeoTools you will need a copy of <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven 2</a>.  Maven is a project management tool from the Apache group.  
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, the build process was known to work with the Maven 2.0.8 release.
</p>
<p>
Once you have maven installed, you can perform a full build by moving to the geotools folder and typing:
<pre>
mvn install
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Please read the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOT/2.5+Using+Maven">Developers Guide</a> for more information about maven:
