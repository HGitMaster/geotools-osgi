<p ><b>GeoTools 2.6.5</b></p>
<p>Thank you for downloading GeoTools 2.6.5. This release was created on: August 8th, 2010.</p>
<p>This release contains only a subset of the current GeoTools codebase. The full GeoTools codebase is made up of over 30 modules; Only the modules which are considered to be stable will be included in this release.</p>
<p>For more information, and documentation on the GeoTools library please see our <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS"><span class="s1">Community Wiki</span></a> or the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTDOC"><span class="s1">User Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b></p>
<p>The details contained in the rest of this file are provided as a quick start reference. For full details on requirements and build process please see the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOT/Home"><span class="s1">Developers' Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
<p>To use the GeoTools libraries you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java 5 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>GeoTools will benefit from the inclusion of Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) and the Java Image IO (JIO) extensions in your JRE. In addition some formats require the ImageIO-Ext additions which explicitly support raster formats such as MRSID and ECW.</p>
<p>You can obtain the latest versions of both of these <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html"><span class="s1">here</span></a>. Detailed instructions can be found <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Dependencies"><span class="s1">here</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>ORACLE REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
<p>In order to use the Oracle module, you need the Oracle JDBC driver from Oracle. Unlike most external libraries used in GeoTools, we cannot redistribute this jar.</p>
<p>However, you can obtain them from the Oracle website, free of charge, after registering: - http://otn.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html Please see the developers guide for more information.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING</b></p>
<p>In order to build GeoTools you will need a copy of <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html"><span class="s1">Maven 2</span></a>. Maven is a project management tool from the Apache group.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the build process was known to work with the Maven 2.1.0 release.</p>
<p>Once you have maven installed, you can perform a full build by moving to the GeoTools folder and typing:</p>
<p class="p5">mvn install</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p>Please read the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOT/2.5+Using+Maven"><span class="s1">Developers Guide</span></a> for more information about maven:</p>
<p><b>GETTING INVOLVED</b></p>
<p>For general queries the <a href="mailto:geotools-gt2-users@lists.sourceforge.net"><span class="s1">gt2-users mailing list</span></a> is available.</p>
