The gt-main module provides default implementations for the remaining gt-api and gt-opengis interfaces (Filter, Style, Feature etc...) and enough glue code to make creating an application possible (various builders and utility classes).

The gt-main module is responsible for:

* Default implementation :doc:`gt-opengis <../opengis/index>` interfaces for Feature, FeatureType and Filter and Style
* Default set of :doc:`gt-opengis <../api/convert>` Converters supporting basic Java types
* Default set of :doc:`gt-opengis <../opengis/filter>` Functions for working with spatial data
* Helper classes for your own application development such as *DataUtilities* and *SimpleFeatureTypeBuilder*
* Abstract classes to help implementors of :doc:`gt-api <../api/index>` DataStore
