============

There are a number of ways one can contribute to the GeoTools project.

Mailing Lists
-------------

The project mailing lists are the best and way to get help with GeoTools as well
as stay in touch with what is happening with the project.

The 
`users list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-gt2-users>`_
is the forum . If you are having a problem with GeoTools,
something does not work or you think you have encountered a bug, report it to 
this list.
  
The 
`developer list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-devel>`_
is meant for discussions that pertaining to the actual
development of the geotools library. If you have a patch you would like to 
contribute, or an issue with a plug-in you are working on, discuss it on this 
list. This is list is also open to anyone who would like to take part in the
more day to day development discussion.

is for the care and feeding of the GeoTools project.

Bug Tracker
-----------

Reporting bugs is one of the most valuable thing a user can do to contribute to
an open source project such as GeoTools. GeoTools uses a system known as 
`JIRA <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT>`_ to manage bugs, issues, and new
features. If you have found a bug, or if there is a feature that you would like
to see implemented in GeoToools, please report it in JIRA.

Developers Guide
----------------

The `developers guide <http://docs.geotools.org/latest/developer/>`_ records the
policies, procedures and build environment for the GeoTools project. If you would
like to know how to get commit access, or build GeoTools from scratch this is the
right place.
