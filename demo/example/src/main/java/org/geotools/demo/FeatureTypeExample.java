/**
 * You may of noticed that the use of DataUtilities.createType in the Csv2Shape
 * was a bit of a hack.
 * <p>
 * Here is why we only use the createType method in examples and test cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It did not let us specify the projection; you saw we needed to use
 * ShapefileDataStore explicity in order to call an extra method to "force" the
 * projection to to WSG84.
 * <li>It did not let us specify any constrains (say maximum length of the
 * name field).
 * <li>We did not make use of a "Factory", so our code has no opportunity to be
 * context sensitive (choosing the appropriate implementation for the type we
 * are representing)
 * </ul>
 * The following example code can be used as a reference when fixing up
 * Csv2Shape on your own.

	 * <b>only</b> use the static final methods to get anything done. This is
	 * something we are fixing for GeoTools 2.5.
